# rock-paper-scissors

- This is a rock, paper, scissors game that I will create using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- I plan on making the game themed after the DND show's, Critical Role, version: Boulder, Parchment, Shears.
- This project is currently a work in progress.


**Update:**
- I added computerPlay(), playRound(string input, string input),  game(), and capatilize() functions.
- The game plays on the console.
- I added buttons for inputs instead of prompt.

**Goals:**
- Implement CSS and HTML to make it astheticly pleasing
- Make the reaction time for the game faster. As it is now, if I spam a button, it does not always register.
